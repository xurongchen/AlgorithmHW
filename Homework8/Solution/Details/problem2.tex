\textit{\textbf{Transitive closure of a dynamic graph}}

Suppose that we wish to maintain the transitive closure of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ as we insert edges into $E$.
That is, after each edge has been inserted, we want to update the transitive closure of the edges inserted so far. 
Assume that the graph $G$ has no edges initially and that we represent the transitive closure as a boolean matrix.

\textbf{a.} Show how to update the transitive closure $G^*=(V,E^*)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ in $O(V^2)$ time when a 
new edge is added to $G$.

\textbf{b.} Give an example of a graph $G$ and an edge $e$ such that $\Omega(V^2)$ time is required to update the 
transitive closure after the insertion of $e$ into $G$, no matter what algorithm is used.

\textbf{c.} Describe an efficient algorithm for updating the transitive closure as edges are inserted into the 
graph. For any sequence of $n$ insertions, your algorithm should run in total time $\sum_{i=1}^n{t_i} = O(V^3)$, 
where $t_i$ is the time to update the transitive closure upon inserting the $i$th edge. Prove that your algorithm 
attains this time bound.
