A directed graph $G = (V,E)$ is \textit{\textbf{semiconnected}} if, 
for all pairs of vertices $u,v \in V$ , we have $u \leadsto v$ or $v \leadsto u$. 
Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not $G$ is 
semiconnected. Prove that your algorithm is correct, and analyze 
its running time.
