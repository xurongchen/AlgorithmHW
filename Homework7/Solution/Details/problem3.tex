Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected, connected graph whose weight function is $w$: 
$E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and suppose that $|E| > |V|$ and all edge weights are 
distinct.

We define a second-best minimum spanning tree as follows. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the 
set of all spanning trees of $G$, and let $T'$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G$. 
Then a \textit{\textbf{second-best minimum spanning tree}} is a spanning tree $T$ such 
that $w(T) = \min_{T'' \in \mathcal{T}-{T'}}\{w(T'')\}$.

\textbf{a.} Show that the minimum spanning tree is unique, but that the second-best 
minimum spanning tree need not be unique.

\textbf{b.} Let $T$ be the minimum spanning tree of $G$. Prove that $G$ contains edges
$(u,v) \in T$ and $(x,y) \notin T$ such that $T-\{(u,v)\}\cup\{(x,y)\}$ is a second-best 
minimum spanning tree of $G$.

\textbf{c.} Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$ and, for any two vertices $u,v \in V$, 
let $max[u,v]$ denote an edge of maximum weight on the unique simple path between 
$u$ and $v$ in $T$. Describe an $O(V^2)$-time algorithm that, given $T$, computes 
$max[u,v]$ for all $u,v \in V$.

\textbf{d.} Give an efficient algorithm to compute the second-best minimum spanning 
tree of $G$.
