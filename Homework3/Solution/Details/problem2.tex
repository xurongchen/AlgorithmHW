We are given $n$ points in the unit circle, $p_i=(x_i,y_i)$,
such that $0<x_i^2 + y_i^2 \le 1$ for $i = 1,2,\cdots,n$. 
Suppose that the points are uniformly distributed; that is, 
the probability of finding a point in any region of the circle 
is proportional to the area of that region. Design an algorithm 
with an average-case running time of $\Theta(n)$ to sort the $n$ 
points by their distances $d_i=\sqrt{x_i^2+y_i^2}$ from the origin. 
(Hint: Design the bucket sizes in BUCKET-SORT to reflect the 
uniform distribution of the points in the unit circle.)
