\textbf{\textbf{Minimun path cover}}

A path cover of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set $P$ of vertex-disjoint 
paths such that every vertex in $V$ is included in exactly one path in $P$. 
Paths may start and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. 
A \textbf{Minimun path cover} of $G$ is a path cover containing the fewest 
possible paths.

\textbf{a.} Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum path cover of a 
directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E)$. (Hint: Assuming that $V=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, 
construct the graph $G'=(V',E')$,where\\
$V' =\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n\}\cup \{y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$,\\
$E' =\{(x_0,x_i):i\in V\}\cup \{(y_i,y_0):i\in V\}\cup (x_i,y_j):(i,j)\in E$,\\
and run a maximum-flow algorithm.)

\textbf{b.} Does your algorithm work for directed graphs that contain cycles? Explain.
