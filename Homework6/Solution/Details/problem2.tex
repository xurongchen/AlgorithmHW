Suppose that instead of contracting a table by halving its size 
when its load factor drops below $1/4$, we contract it by multiplying 
its size by $2/3$ when its load factor drops below $1/3$. Using the 
potential function\\
$\Phi(T) = | 2\cdot T.num - T.size|$\\
show that the amortized cost of a \proc{Table-Delete} that uses 
this strategy is bounded above by a constant.
